## Definition Statement

- I want to build an application that helps the user read and understand a
  variety of poetry written in the English language via user comments and
  easy-to-access dictionary definitions

## Target Audience

- Those who enjoy reading poetry and find meaning in the words
- Students of the English language who would like to have a streamlined way of
  learning new phrases and word definitions
- People who enjoy posting their thoughts publicly for others to consume

## Inspiration

- [Genius Lyrics](https://genius.com/Foo-fighters-everlong-lyrics) - Likes -
  ability to read commenters’ interpretation of lyrics on a chunk basis. -
  likes/dislikes on annotations & comments - Dislikes - bloat from ads and
  popups - cannot listen to song on its own lyric page

- [Song Meanings](https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/1959/) - Likes - link to
  play the song is available - comment section at the bottom - Dislikes - bloat
  from ads - play song link is paywalled - no ability to highlight chunks and
  comment specifically

_Rhyme Remarks will be different because it will feature a comment section for
chunks and at the bottom. It will be free to play the poem out loud (TTS).
Additionally, mine will have some additional features beyond these lyrics apps
such as the ability to submit composed poems to the database and a 5-star review
system._
